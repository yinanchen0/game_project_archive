## Overview

This project is a two-player card-based fighting game developed in Unity using C#.
Gameplay is controlled through user hand gestures, which are mapped to different cards
and combat techniques, linking physical hand movements to in-game actions.

## Features
- Gesture-based input for card activation and combat skills
- Turn-based combat system with health and power management
- Card effect resolution and skill logic
- Animation-driven combat execution and visual feedback
- Modular game logic and state-based gameplay flow

## Development Notes
This project was built as an experimental learning project and remains unfinished.
The focus was on exploring gesture-driven interaction, gameplay system design,
and iterative debugging for stability and responsiveness.
